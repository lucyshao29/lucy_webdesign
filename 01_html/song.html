		<p>I've learned to slam on the brake</p>
		<p>Before I even turn the key</p>
		<p>Before I make the mistake</p>
		<p>Before I lead with the worst of me</p>
		<p>Give them no reason to stare</p>
		<p>No slipping up if you slip away</p>
		<p>So I got nothing to share</p>
		<p>No, I got nothing to say</p>

		<p>Step     out,</p>
		<p>Step     out</p>
		<p>of the sun</p>
		<p>If you keep getting burned</p>
		<p>Step     out,</p>
		<p>Step     out</p>
		<p>of the sun</p>
		<p>Because you've learned,</p>
		<p>because you've learned</p>

		<p>On the outside, always looking in</p>
		<p>Will I ever be more than I've always been?</p>
		<p>'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass</p>
		<p>I'm waving through a window</p>
		<p>I try to speak, but nobody can hear</p>
		<p>So I wait around for an answer to appear</p>
		<p>While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass</p>
		<p>I'm waving through a window, oh</p>
		<p>Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?</p>

		<p>We start with stars in our eyes</p>
		<p>We start believing that we belong</p>
		<p>But every sun doesn't rise</p>
		<p>And no one tells you where you went wrong</p>

		<p>Step     out,</p>
		<p>Step     out</p>
		<p>of the sun</p>
		<p>If you keep getting burned</p>
		<p>Step     out,</p>
		<p>Step     out</p>
		<p>of the sun</p>
		<p>Because you've learned,</p>
		<p>because you've learned</p>

		<p>On the outside, always looking in</p>
		<p>Will I ever be more than I've always been?</p>
		<p>'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass</p>
		<p>I'm waving through a window</p>
		<p>I try to speak, but nobody can hear</p>
		<p>So I wait around for an answer to appear</p>
		<p>While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass</p>
		<p>I'm waving through a window, oh</p>
		<p>Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?</p>

		<p>When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around</p>
		<p>Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?</p>
		<p>When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around</p>
		<p>Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?</p>
		<p>When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around</p>
		<p>Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?</p>
		<p>When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around</p>
		<p>Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?</p>
		<p>Did I even make a sound?</p>
		<p>Did I even make a sound?</p>
		<p>It's like I never made a sound</p>
		<p>Will I ever make a sound?</p>

		<p>On the outside, always looking in</p>
		<p>Will I ever be more than I've always been?</p>
		<p>'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass</p>
		<p>I'm waving through a window</p>
